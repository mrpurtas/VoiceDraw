VoiceDraw is more than just an application; it offers a creative experience directed by voice.Our project encompasses elements such as visual generation, voice generation, 
and multi-form work. The concept of creating visuals through voice commands forms the foundation of our project.

Our project goes beyond generating visuals from voice, offering an innovative structure through multi-form integration. Users interact with artificial intelligence, 
iteratively improving the visuals they create over and over again. This process creates an experience akin to conversing with artificial intelligence. Additionally, 
for cost management, we used OpenAI services alongside Google Gemini Pro Vision services and will continue to work on further optimization.
